The code found in this repository can be used to generate Figures 5, 6, 9, and 11 in the manuscript. It is broken up into 4 sections:
  -survey (Figures 5 and 6): code for the restraint analysis portion of the paper (a survey of NOE restraints between amide protons and aromatic ring protons in paired BMRB and PDB entries) \
  -mosart (Figure 9): code for analysis of the van der Waals interaction between an ALA amide proton and a PHE aromatic ring as the proton approaches the ring \
  -dep (Figure 11): code for analysis of BMRB deposition trends, specifically structure depositions, structure depositions using CS Rosetta, and runs executed using the BMRB CS-Rosetta server by year \
